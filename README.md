 Nagios script that interact to a website to check if itÂ´s OK

## Pre requisites:

### System:

 ### Python:

## Running the script

The script works in two parts.
 
The run_firefox is responsable to keep a firefox instance open and running for use.

```shell
 ./run_firefox -p port [Mandatory] -f profile [Optional]
```

Then you may put it to run in crontab or even create a service in Nagios to check if any firefox instance is running at the given port.

Then run the check:

```shell
 ./check_website.py -u http://www.foobar.com -w 5 -c 10 -e module_to_execute -p port
```

It will use the firefox running at the given port to make the check and then returns the time spent in case of success.

The module_to_execute is a python script that is imported as a module and executed. It should contain the step by step interaction writen in it

There is an file called search_google.py for an example.
